### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS [CSS Framework]
- Google Fonts
- Usebasin [for handling forms]
- reCAPTCHA v2
- Dark Theme included

### What I learned

This is my second project in Tailwind CSS. In this project I learnt to create dark theme feature for my site. Also I learnt form submission feature, including reCAPTCHA v2 and doing basic JS

I learnt to use some basic animation features

### Continued development

Now I want to focus on optimizing my sites and creating a loading page. I noticed that this site takes some time to load all the images. 

I'll try to update it with time as per I learn new things.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give some credits to [Great Stack]('https://greatstack.dev/'). I got the project idea from his [Youtube channel]('https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev'). I just tried to built the site on my own. here's his design's [live demo]('https://www.elianajade.com/')

Also [Basin]('https://usebasin.com/app/forms') helped to build to form sumbission system without focusing on backend. I got to include recaptcha v2 in my website as for their free service.
