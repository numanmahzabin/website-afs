## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give some credits to [Great Stack]('https://greatstack.dev/'). I got the project idea from his [Youtube channel]('https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev'). I just tried to built the site on my own. here's his design's [live demo]('https://www.elianajade.com/')

Also [Basin]('https://usebasin.com/app/forms') helped to build to form sumbission system without focusing on backend. I got to include recaptcha v2 in my website as for their free service.
